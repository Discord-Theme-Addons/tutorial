# Discord Theme Add-ons / Mini-Themes
This organization includes all of the theme add-ons (or mini-themes) that I've made. If you're new to using client mods on Discord, contine reading this repo as it can assist you with installation.

## Client Mod Installation
Most of these theme add-ons have support for **multiple client mods, as well as support on web.** A list of supported client mods are:
- **[BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net)**
    - **[Direct Installation Help](https://github.com/Discord-Theme-Addons/tutorial#betterdiscord-installation)**
- **[Powercord](https://powercord.dev)**        
    - **[Direct Installation Help](https://github.com/Discord-Theme-Addons/tutorial#powercord-installation)** 
- **[Vizality](https://vizality.com/)**
    - **[Direct Installation Help](https://github.com/Discord-Theme-Addons/tutorial#vizality-installation)**
- **[Stylus (WEB)](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus)**
    - **[Direct Installation Help](https://github.com/Discord-Theme-Addons/tutorial#stylus-installation)**

Now, you may be asking yourself: "okay, so how exactly does this work? are client mods against tos? how do i get the amazing themes?" 
- For information on how to install specific client mods, continue reading this repo. Find the desired client mod, preferabbly the easiest one to install for you, and read the instructions on how to install.
- For information on how to install some of the theme add-ons, all repos in the org come with instructions on how to install the specific theme. 
- As for "is it against ToS?", the short answer is ***yes, it is.*** However, currently **Discord is not going out of their way to terminate users for the usage of client mods**. Note that Stylus isn't exactly against ToS since it doesn't do things that a client mod would do. As long as you don't use anything that absue Discord's API, which the client mods listed above won't allow, you can't really get in much trouble. Though it is your decision if you want to use client mods or not.
